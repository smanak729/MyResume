# MyResume
# PE01
This React App program inputs student information and displays the information within a resume template.
# Input
For this project, I created a React app that displays a student resume. For this project, I created two main files: Resume.js and Resume.css. Within the Resume.js file, I inputted the following information: Student Name, Information, Education, and Programs (experience). Once all revelant information was inputted, I configured the Resume.css file.
# Process
When creating the Resume.js file, I utilized className for each specific category, making formatting easier within the Resume.css file. For each className, I formatted the margin, font size, and color. Once finished, I redirected the App.js file to display the information from Resume.js using the Resume.css formatting.
# Output
The final output was the Resume which included all information from Resume.js formatted according to Resume.css
